## Abstract
The U.S. health system is unique in its reliance on private insurance and cost-sharing mechanisms, which often place financial burdens on patients despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Coinsurance, a major cost-sharing mechanism, depends on age and insurance plan types, which alter out-of-pocket expenses. This study uses Two-Way ANOVA to test the effects of age groups and plan types on coinsurance rates. The results show that plan type significantly affects coinsurance rates (p < 0.05), while age group does not (p > 0.05). There is no significant interaction effect between age groups and plan types. These findings highlight the importance of plan type in cost-sharing mechanisms and provide insights for designing equitable and affordable health insurance policies.

## Introduction
The U.S. healthcare system is characterized by its reliance on private insurance and cost-sharing mechanisms, which create complexities and financial burdens for patients. Unlike most developed countries with universal healthcare, individuals in the U.S. face varying premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. This study aims to analyze the variations in coinsurance rates across age groups and insurance plan types using Two-Way ANOVA. The analysis seeks to determine whether significant differences exist in coinsurance rates and whether there is an interaction effect between age groups and plan types.

## Background

### The Process of Data Analysis
The data analysis process involves iterative steps, including:
1. **Understanding the Problem and Desired Results**: Defining research goals and metrics.
2. **Gathering Data**: Identifying relevant data sources and tools.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
4. **Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to discover trends and patterns.
5. **Results Interpretation**: Verifying statistical significance and limitations.
6. **Presenting Findings**: Communicating insights through reports, charts, and graphs.

### Two-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
Two-Way ANOVA is used to analyze the effects of two independent variables on a dependent variable. It evaluates:
- **Main Effect of the First Factor**: The impact of the first independent variable on the dependent variable.
- **Main Effect of the Second Factor**: The impact of the second independent variable on the dependent variable.
- **Interaction Effect**: Whether the two factors together have a unique effect on the dependent variable.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
The data was sourced from the U.S. Health Insurance Marketplace (via Kaggle) and included three datasets:
1. **BenefitsCostSharing.csv**: Contains coinsurance details.
2. **Rate.csv**: Includes age groupings and rates.
3. **PlanAttributes.csv**: Lists insurance plan types (PPO, POS, HMO, EPO, Indemnity).

### Data Cleaning
- **Processing Complex Coinsurance Descriptions**: Standardized descriptions into numeric values.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Removed records with missing values.
- **Merging Datasets**: Integrated data from the three datasets using common keys.
- **Binning Age Groups**: Categorized ages into six groups (0-20, 21-25, 26-40, 41-60, 61-64, 65+).

### Statistical Analysis
- **Two-Way ANOVA**: Tested the effects of age groups and plan types on coinsurance rates.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Normality of the dependent variable.
  - Homogeneity of variance (tested using Levene's Test).

## Results

### Key Findings
1. **Plan Type**: Statistically significant effect on coinsurance rates (p < 0.05).
2. **Age Group**: No significant effect on coinsurance rates (p > 0.05).
3. **Interaction Effect**: No significant interaction between age groups and plan types (p > 0.05).

### Statistical Results
- **Main Effect of Plan Type**: Significant (p < 0.05).
- **Main Effect of Age Group**: Not significant (p > 0.05).
- **Interaction Effect**: Not significant (p > 0.05).

### Visualizations
- **Q-Q Plot**: Showed normal distribution of coinsurance rates.
- **Histogram**: Depicted bell-shaped distribution for some subgroups.

## Conclusion
The study concludes that plan type significantly affects coinsurance rates, while age group does not. There is no interaction effect between age groups and plan types. These findings emphasize the importance of plan type in cost-sharing mechanisms and provide insights for designing equitable and affordable health insurance policies. Future work will explore multiple regression models to investigate the relationship between additional variables and coinsurance rates.
